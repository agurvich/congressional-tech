For each form, it extracts all visible labels, input types, and field metadata.\nFuzzy matching & mapping: Each scraped form’s fields are run through a fuzzy matching engine that adds them to a growing canonical list of standardized field names. This process builds a crosswalk: a mapping from each live label to a canonical schema key (e.g., mapping \"Title of Project\" → \"Project Name\"). The result is stored in a translations.csv (or JSON) file, associating each MOC’s form fields with standardized identifiers.\nSchema & version publishing: The translations.csv and a version.txt file (containing a hash) are published publicly (committed to the repo and accessed by `raw.githubusercontent.com`) for use by the template sheet and chrome/firefox extension.\nTemplate Sheet: A read-only Google Sheet imports translations.csv into a hidden sheet using =IMPORTDATA. A second, visible, sheet exposes only the ~15 common input columns. The hidden sheet uses formulas to reference the visible columns based on the precomputed mappings from translations.csv, generating values for all 500 canonical fields without additional user input.\nVersion enforcement: The sheet also imports the remote version.txt into a designated cell (ABG: there needs to be a hard copy step at template duplication otherwise this will be a circular reference). The Chrome extension checks this value against the latest published value (by accessing it itself). If there’s a mismatch, the extension blocks execution, ensuring users don’t submit data using an outdated template sheet.\nStaffer workflow: Staffers duplicate the template and enter their data in the ~15 visible fields. Once ready, they click the Chrome extension to begin the guided submission process.\nChrome Extension: The extension loads the full ~500 field values from the hidden sheet values into memory (ABG: or if necessary don't hide the sheet, point is to avoid auth by scraping the values directly from the open tab) and presents a UI showing submission progress. The extension will navigate the user to each MOC's form and autofill in the correct inputs from the ~500 field values on the live Google Form. The staffer manually reviews each form and submits. After each form, they advance to the next using the extension UI.\nABG: Could also build out the Chrome extension such that clicking it from any page that isn't the template will duplicate a new template for you and navigate you to it. For the proposed enhancement, that would require live fuzzy matching which would require a backend and an API. Very different solution required-- unfortunately. Could look into browser-based fuzzy matching solutions with web assembly."

        "description": "Link agency CBJ sections to matching appropriations report language using keywords, topic modeling, and ML.",
        "problem": "Connecting agency budget justifications (CBJs) with relevant sections of appropriations committee reports (which explain funding decisions and provide directives to agencies) requires manual cross-referencing and analysis.",
        "solution": "Develop a system to automatically link sections of CBJs to corresponding sections in appropriations committee reports. This could involve:\n\tKeyword Matching: Identifying shared keywords and phrases between CBJ sections and report sections.\n\tTopic Modeling: Using natural language processing techniques to identify thematic similarities between documents.\n\tMachine Learning: Training a model to recognize relationships between CBJ requests and committee report language.",
        "value-hsd": "Streamlines the analysis of appropriations bills by directly connecting stated agency funding requests with congressional justifications and directives articulated in committee reports. Facilitates a deeper understanding of appropripriations intent and the rationale behind funding decisions.",
        "value-ctdc": "Enhances public understanding of how congressional appropriations align (or deviate from) agency budget requests and policy priorities as expressed in report language. Promotes greater accountability and transparency in the appropriations process.",
