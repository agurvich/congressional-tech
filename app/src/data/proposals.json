Implement automated data scraping where possible.\n\t- Public-Facing Platform (Wiki/Website): Publish the aggregated data on a user-friendly website or wiki, with clear navigation and search capabilities. Manage hyperlinks appropriately.\n\t- Alert System: Develop an alert system (e.g., email notifications) to notify users when new information is added for committees they are tracking. Priority: House Administration and Senate Rules Committees.",
