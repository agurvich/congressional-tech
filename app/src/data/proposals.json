        "problem": "Information about congressional hearings and markups is scattered across multiple websites (Congress.gov, Docs.house.gov, committee pages, YouTube), making it difficult for staff and the public to get a comprehensive view of legislative activity.",
        "solution": "Create a centralized, regularly updated platform (initially a spreadsheet, then a public-facing website/wiki) that aggregates key data points:\nDate of the hearing or markup.\nEvent Type (Hearing or Markup).\nTitle of the Proceeding (and separate column for Event ID).\nCommittee of Jurisdiction (and separate column for unique Committee ID).\nIndication of Full Committee or Subcommittee proceeding.\nDirect Links to:\n\tThe committee's webpage for the proceeding.\n\tThe Docs.house.gov page for the proceeding (if it's a House event).\n\tThe video of the proceeding (YouTube or Akami).\n\tThe transcript of the proceeding (when available).\nPhases:\n\tData Aggregation (Spreadsheet): Build the initial spreadsheet, populating it with data from the various sources. Implement automated data scraping where possible.\n\tPublic-Facing Platform (Wiki/Website): Publish the aggregated data on a user-friendly website or wiki, with clear navigation and search capabilities. Manage hyperlinks appropriately.\n\tAlert System: Develop an alert system (e.g., email notifications) to notify users when new information is added for committees they are tracking.
